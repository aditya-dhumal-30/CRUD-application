# CRUD-application
 I built a basic CRUD Web application using Express.js, EJS, and UUID to manage user posts dynamically. The app allows users to create, view, and read individual posts. This project helped me strengthen my backend development skills and gain hands-on experience with routing, templating engines, and middleware in Express.
